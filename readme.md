 In recent years, Graphic Interchange Format (GIF) has witnessed a remarkable growth in popularity as a simple but powerful communication tool in online social networking and messaging platforms. Therefore, online tools such as giphy, gifs.com or ezgif are used by a lot of users to create their GIFs manually from videos. The task of creating GIFs from videos is similar to the problem of highlight detection from videos. Highlight detection models are trained to identify appealing or interesting visual contents from input videos. As the notion of ‘appealing’ or ‘interestingness’ is highly subjective among users, non-personalized highlight detection models generate results with limited relevance to the individual user. As a consequence, Prior research has proposed highlight detection models conditioned on the individual user’s history to overcome the limitation of non-personalized models. In this project, we aim to develop a personalized highlight detection model, category-aware personalized highlight detection (C-PHD), conditioned on user history and video categories.
